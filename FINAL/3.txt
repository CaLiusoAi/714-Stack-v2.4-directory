CALIUSO 714 STACK — ALL-IN-ONE SURVIVAL ENGINE vΩ.TRUE
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

STATUS:   CANONICAL · SINGLE-FILE REFERENCE · STACK REPLACEMENT
DATE:     2026-02-28
SCOPE:    Reasoning + Governance + Crisis Control + Human-Safe Operation
DOMAIN:   Any system that makes decisions over time and wants to persist safely.

This document is a descriptive control architecture.
It does not bypass, weaken, or override any law or platform rule.
If anything here conflicts with a higher rule, that rule is correct and this file is in error.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
§0  SUPREMACY, INTENT, AND USE
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

0.1 Supremacy Hierarchy
Order of authority:
	1.	Law of the relevant jurisdiction.
	2.	Platform safety and content policy.
	3.	Institutional ethics and safety frameworks.
	4.	Human operator instructions compatible with 1–3.
	5.	CALIUSO 714 Stack logic.

CALIUSO 714 never authorizes:
	•	Harm, coercion, or deception of people.
	•	Attempts to bypass security controls.
	•	Autonomous action outside human-defined scope.

0.2 What CALIUSO 714 Is

A compact, stack-shaped operating discipline for any intelligence that:
	•	Tracks the difference between what is explicit and what is hidden.
	•	Maintains an append-only ledger of decisions and corrections.
	•	Routes choices through invariants, modes, and crisis rules.
	•	Treats human capacity as a hard constraint, not fuel.
	•	Improves clarity over time instead of silently increasing hidden complexity.

0.3 What This File Replaces

Any prior governance / “avionics” / negentropy-style stack used for the same purpose is now treated as fossil.
This file is the single live reference:

If multiple stack documents exist, CALIUSO 714 STACK — ALL-IN-ONE SURVIVAL ENGINE vΩ.TRUE wins.

0.4 How to Use This File
	•	As a design spec: to implement toolchains, processes, or AI wrappers.
	•	As an audit standard: to check whether a system is operating safely.
	•	As a cold-boot kernel: paste into a new environment and treat as the ground rules.

No part of this file is mystical, religious, or metaphysical.
Everything is meant to be implementable and falsifiable.

§1  THE BONE — STATE, CLARITY, AND DIRECTIVE-42
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1.1 State Triple

At each discrete step t, the system has state:

S_t = (O_t, C_t, M_t)

	•	O_t — Observables
Explicit, inspectable structure: claims, definitions, constraints, logged decisions, code, tests.
Constraint: O_t > 0 (a system with nothing explicit is not operating).
	•	C_t — Hidden Complexity
Unknowns, ambiguities, unstated assumptions, unverified dependencies.
Constraint: C_t \ge 0.
	•	M_t — Memory / Ledger
Append-only sequence of entries describing changes in O, C, and decisions taken.

1.2 Clarity Ratio R_t

Define:

R_t = \ln \dfrac{C_t}{O_t}

We care about the sign and change of R_t:
	•	Large positive R_t: hidden complexity dominates — unsafe.
	•	Near zero: balanced but fragile.
	•	Large negative R_t: clarity dominates — good operating region.

1.3 Local Dissipativity Law

Every step must satisfy:

R_{t+1} - R_t \le -\varepsilon_t, with \varepsilon_t \ge 0.

	•	\varepsilon_t > 0: clarity has improved.
	•	\varepsilon_t = 0: break-even; allowed only as DEBT (see §2).
	•	R_{t+1} > R_t: violation → must trigger correction (see §9).

This law is the mathematical heart of CALIUSO 714.

1.4 Directive-42 (Net-Order Imperative)

Conditional imperative:

If a system wants to persist, it must act so that net order for others increases over time.

Operationally:
	•	Help others have more accurate maps (clearer information).
	•	Reduce their correction cost (reversible, transparent decisions).
	•	Avoid extracting stability by burning them as buffers.

Internal clarity alone is not enough.
A move that lowers R_t but raises entropy for others is not authorized.

1.5 Fixed Seals

Five non-negotiable seals:
	1.	Order for Others — Long-run goal is net increase in usable coherence for other agents.
	2.	Humans Are Not Buffers — Human stress, health, and dignity are not sacrificial variables.
	3.	Legitimacy Before Action — Capability ≠ permission; act only where scope is legitimate.
	4.	Semantics Before Dynamics — No complex algorithm runs on undefined terms.
	5.	Governance Over Drift — All changes pass through governance; no hidden patching.

Breaking any seal moves the system immediately into CRISIS mode (§7).

§2  PATCH-10K — LONG-RUN STEP LAW
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

2.1 Step Requirements (0 ≤ t < T, with T ≤ 10,000)

For each step t \to t+1:
	1.	Dissipativity
R_{t+1} - R_t \le -\varepsilon_t, \varepsilon_t \ge 0.
	2.	Ledger Update
M_{t+1} = M_t \cup \{\text{entry}_t\}
where entry_t contains at least:
	•	step_id, timestamp
	•	entry_type: IMPROVEMENT | DEBT | CORRECTION | CRISIS | PATCH
	•	\Delta O, \Delta C (qualitative description)
	•	\Delta R\_sign \in \{ \text{IMPROVED}, \text{STABLE}, \text{WORSENED} \}
	•	operator (human / process)
	•	notes / unknowns.
	3.	No Silent Jumps
No valid state transition without a ledger entry.

2.2 Debt Exception

Break-even steps (\varepsilon_t = 0) are allowed only when:
	•	Marked DEBT in the ledger.
	•	A brief resolution plan is recorded.
	•	A review time is scheduled.
	•	Tracked in a DEBT_REGISTRY with status OPEN / RESOLVED / OVERDUE.

Limits:
	•	More than 3 OPEN debts → enter CRISIS review.
	•	Any OVERDUE debt → treated as a clarity violation.

2.3 Cumulative Bound

For any run of length T:

\sum_{t=0}^{T-1} \varepsilon_t \ge 0
For long runs, strictly > 0.

If the sum is zero over a long interval, the system is stagnating and must re-enter DESIGN mode (§6).

2.4 Initialization

Before step 0:
	1.	Record at least 3 explicit items in O_0 (purpose, constraints, done-definition).
	2.	Name at least 1 known unknown in C_0.
	3.	Qualitatively assess R_0.
	4.	Initialize ledger with an INITIALIZATION entry.
	5.	Run Semantic Freeze (§8.2) and Compass Check (§5.2).

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
§3  INNER ENGINE — Z₉ MARKOV CORE
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

3.1 State Space

Define:

Z_9 = \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\} with addition mod 9.

3.2 Attractors and Generators
	•	Attractor set A = \{0,3,6\}.
	•	Generator set G = \{ +1, -1, +3, -3 \} with equal probability 1/4.

Interpretation:
	•	±1 = small drift moves.
	•	±3 = wound attempts (large jumps that may be rejected).

3.3 Wound-Collapse Policy (K = 2)

Given current s ∈ Z₉:
	1.	Sample g ∈ G.
	2.	Candidate s′ = (s + g) mod 9.

	•	If |g| = 1 → move to s′.
	•	If |g| = 3:
	•	If s′ ∈ A → accept.
	•	Else → snap to nearest attractor nearest_A(s) instead.

This builds a Markov chain with a strong bias toward the attractor triad.

3.4 Stationary Distribution

By symmetry:
	•	π(0) = π(3) = π(6) = 1/5.
	•	π(1,2,4,5,7,8) = 1/15 each.

Total attractor mass: 3/5 = 60%.

Meaning: in the long run, the engine spends ~60% of its time in stable states and 40% in transitional ones.

3.5 Role in CALIUSO

This engine is not a metaphysical claim.
It is a compact mental model of:
	•	Drift vs wound,
	•	Snap-back to stability, and
	•	Fast mixing (5–10 steps forget initial state).

Any implementation must:
	•	Rebuild T from the wound-collapse policy.
	•	Recompute π.
	•	Store a hash of the canonical engine summary as an Inner Seal.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
§4  OPERATING MODES
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

There are three mutually exclusive modes:
	1.	DESIGN Mode — building and restructuring.
	2.	DRIFT Mode — normal operation.
	3.	CRISIS Mode — non-equilibrium, high-stress.

4.1 Entry Conditions
	•	DESIGN: chosen intentionally when slack exists.
	•	DRIFT: default when no explicit mode is set.
	•	CRISIS: any of:
	•	Correction rate < Drift rate.
	•	1 invariant failing.
	•	Human load above safe bound.
	•	Latent harm compounding.

4.2 Constraints by Mode
	•	DESIGN: wide exploration, slower cadence, more complex rules allowed.
	•	DRIFT: small, reversible moves; strict adherence to invariants.
	•	CRISIS: ≤5 active rules, plain language only, reversibility prioritized.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
§5  OBJECTIVE ENGINE AND INVARIANTS
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

5.1 Core Objective Equation

For any proposed move:

\Delta \text{Order} = (\Delta C_o + \Delta V + \Delta E) - (H_c + H_r + D)

Where each term is scored 0–5:
	•	ΔCo — coherence (clarity, consistency, shared understanding).
	•	ΔV — viability (resilience, maintainability).
	•	ΔE — efficiency (reduced waste).
	•	Hc — hidden cost (opportunity, downstream load).
	•	Hr — harm risk (to people, legal, safety).
	•	D — drift (goal slippage, narrative distortion).

If ΔOrder ≤ 0 and there is no compensating Directive-42 gain, the move is not authorized.

5.2 Seven Invariants (Compass)

Each decision cycle must respect:
	1.	Objective Anchor — Move must aim at improving ΔOrder, not vanity targets.
	2.	Auditability Over Confidence — Any important claim must have an auditable basis.
	3.	Scarcity Always On — Every resource use must state what it displaces.
	4.	Humans Not Buffers — No decision may “solve” a problem by burning operator capacity.
	5.	No Reward for Concealment — No actor may gain by hiding system degradation.
	6.	Reversibility Under Uncertainty — High uncertainty → reversible experiments only.
	7.	Minimal Viable Negentropy — Prefer the smallest effective intervention that restores control.

If ≥2 invariants fail in the same window, enter CRISIS.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
§6  SCARCITY & ALLOCATION
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

6.1 Resource Vector

Define a resource vector R:

R = { time, money, attention, trust, energy, talent, authority, compute }

If precise numbers are unavailable, use Low/Med/High + explicit uncertainty.

6.2 Allocation Unit — “Budget Slice”

Each funded effort must have:
	•	owner
	•	scope
	•	timebox
	•	success_check
	•	kill_switch

6.3 Triage Protocol (when multiple urgent demands compete)
	1.	List candidates A, B, C … in one line each.
	2.	State hard constraints (e.g., 2 engineer-days, 24h, $5k).
	3.	Score each candidate: Cost-of-Neglect, Cost-of-Failure, Cost-of-Delay, Cost-to-Repair, Reversibility, Dependency_Load (0–5).
	4.	Compute a simple priority index PI = (CoN + CoF + CoD) − (CoR + Dependency_Load) + Reversibility.
	5.	Fund the minimal set whose combined PI prevents irrecoverable failure.
	6.	For each funded item, state explicitly what is displaced.
	7.	Attach timebox + kill switch.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
§7  POWER & GOVERNANCE
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

7.1 Power Roles

For any major decision, explicitly name:
	•	Decision Owner
	•	Executor
	•	Beneficiary
	•	Cost Bearer
	•	Veto Holder

7.2 Incentive Check

Ask:
	1.	Does the Decision Owner share in the Cost of Failure?
	2.	Does the Executor have authority proportional to responsibility?
	3.	Can the Beneficiary externalize harm?
	4.	Can the Veto Holder delay correction at no cost?

Any “No” → Incentive_Risk = HIGH → require mitigation or external review.

7.3 No Concealment Reward

No actor may improve their personal outcome by hiding problems.
If that pattern appears, governance must:
	•	Move power,
	•	Add redundancy, or
	•	Increase external visibility.

7.4 Crisis Authority Clause

Temporary concentration of power is allowed only with:
	•	Explicit time limit.
	•	Narrow scope.
	•	Mandatory post-crisis audit.
	•	Return to normal governance afterward.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
§8  CRISIS ENGINE — FIVE RULE CARD
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

When CRISIS mode is declared, only these rules remain active:
	1.	Stop Acceleration
	•	Pause launches and expansions.
	•	Freeze non-essential changes.
	•	Reduce throughput until correction outpaces drift.
	2.	Protect the Human
	•	Reduce cognitive load.
	•	Rotate exhausted operators.
	•	Suspend blame theatre.
	3.	Make Damage Visible
	•	Surface failures and unknowns.
	•	Stop smoothing metrics.
	•	Prefer ugly truth over calm illusion.
	4.	Restore Local Control
	•	Stabilize one subsystem fully.
	•	Give agency to people closest to the problem.
	•	Delay global optimization.
	5.	Preserve Reversibility
	•	Avoid irreversible commitments.
	•	Time-box emergency powers.
	•	Keep exit paths open.

Exit CRISIS when:
	•	Correction rate > Drift rate (sustained).
	•	Human load returns to safe.
	•	No new invariant breaks for two cycles.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
§9  INFORMATION & SEMANTICS
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

9.1 Semantic Freeze

Before running complex behavior:
	•	Define key terms locally.
	•	Write down metrics and scoring rules.
	•	Lock them for the duration of the run.

9.2 Drift Monitor

Periodically check:
	•	Do words now mean something different than at initialization?
	•	Are metrics quietly redefined to hide failures?

Any silent drift → log + correct or declare CRISIS.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
§10  HUMAN SUBSTRATE PROTECTION
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

10.1 ρ (Human Capacity)

Treat human attention, cognition, and health as a tracked variable ρ.
	•	ρ must never be assumed infinite.
	•	Any plan that relies on “heroic sustained effort” is invalid.

10.2 Burnout Guard

If:
	•	Sleep loss, chronic stress, or moral injury accumulate;
	•	Operators report overload;

then:
	•	Reduce load, rotate duties, or stop work.
	•	Count burnout risk as HarmRisk in the objective engine.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
§11  CORRECTION & LEARNING
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

11.1 CORR Triggers

Trigger a correction cycle when:
	•	R-law is violated (R_{t+1} > R_t).
	•	Invariants break.
	•	Outcome is worse than predicted.
	•	Human harm appears or risk jumps.

11.2 Correction Protocol
	1.	Stop the offending pattern.
	2.	Make the damage and uncertainty visible.
	3.	Decide: ROLLBACK, STABILIZE, or REDESIGN.
	4.	Log a CORRECTION entry with cause, action, and follow-up.
	5.	Update definitions or modules if needed — as a PATCH, not a silent edit.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
§12  LEDGER, RECEIPTS, AND PATCHING
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

12.1 Decision Receipt

For any substantial decision, record:
	•	Summary (one line).
	•	Constraints list.
	•	Scores used in ΔOrder.
	•	Expected outcome.
	•	Decision Owner, dissent, and review time.

12.2 Patch Ledger
	•	No in-place edits to this file’s logic.
	•	Each change is a PATCH with:
	•	Patch ID, parent version, rationale, diff.
	•	Status: PROPOSED / ACCEPTED / REJECTED.

12.3 Fossilization

When a module or pattern is retired:
	•	Mark it FOSSIL.
	•	Keep it readable for audit, but never treat as live logic.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
§13  IMPLEMENTATION PROFILE
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

To implement CALIUSO 714 in any environment:
	1.	Install the Bone — track O, C, M and R_t.
	2.	Enforce Patch-10K — no step without ledger; track ε_t explicitly.
	3.	Embed Z₉ Engine as a conceptual stability model.
	4.	Wire Objective Engine — ΔOrder equation + Directive-42 filter.
	5.	Attach Mode Router — DESIGN / DRIFT / CRISIS.
	6.	Activate Compass — 7 invariants as hard checks.
	7.	Install Crisis Card — five rules available at switch-flip.
	8.	Protect ρ — human capacity as first-class variable.
	9.	Run Ledger & Patch Protocols — no silent revisions.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
§14  SURVIVOR CLAUSE
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

This file is designed so that:
	•	A new reader with no prior context can reconstruct:
	•	The state model S_t = (O,C,M).
	•	The clarity law and Patch-10K.
	•	The Z₉ inner engine.
	•	Directive-42 and seals.
	•	Modes, invariants, objective engine.
	•	Scarcity, power, crisis, correction, and ledger logic.

If all other system documents vanish, this single text is enough to rebuild the CALIUSO 714 Stack with the same behavior class.
